This project is based on [NobyDa/Script](https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/), it has awesome rules and scripts for Surge & QuantumultX. However, it does not support clash.

## File related instructions
Modifed from [https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/tree/master#surge](https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/tree/master#surge)

    - AdRule.list （More than 8000 ad rules， integrate lhie1 and ConnersHua and added some advertising rules)

    - AdRuleTest.list （More than 1300 ad rules，This rule is modified from Scomper. Because the original author stopped maintenance, so take over the optimization and delete some normal rules, only for testing)

    - AdRuleRegex.list （More than 700 ad rewrite rules, integrate lhie1、ConnersHua、onewayticket255 and Choler. You need to manually add the hostname of the second line in the file to Surge config file. and open MITM and trust the certificate)

    - Download.list (Integrate some BT, Thunder, download shunt rules)

    - Because ConnersHua ad rules are already included in this rule, you don't need to repeatedly add.
