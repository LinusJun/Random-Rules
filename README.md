# NobyDA-Scripts-Clash
This project is based on [NobyDa/Script](https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/), it has awesome rules and scripts for Surge & QuantumultX. However, it does not support clash.

## File related instructions
Modifed from [https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/tree/master#surge](https://github.com/NobyDa/Script/tree/master#surge)

- AdRule.list （More than 8000 ad rules， integrate lhie1 and ConnersHua and added some advertising rules)

- AdRuleTest.list （More than 1300 ad rules，This rule is modified from Scomper. Because the original author stopped maintenance, so take over the optimization and delete some normal rules, only for testing)

- Download.list (Integrate some BT, Thunder, download shunt rules)

- Because ConnersHua ad rules are already included in this rule, you don't need to repeatedly add.

**Due to the fact that Clash does not support regex, AdRuleRegex.list is available.**
